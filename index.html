          <h5 class="sub-heading-h5">What is CSS ?</h5>
          <p>1. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet</p>
          <p>
            2. CSS describes how HTML, elements are to be displayed on screen,
            paper or in the other media
          </p>
          <p>
            3. <span class="text-dec">CSS is not necessary</span> CSS saves a
            lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at
            once
          </p>
          <p>
            4.
            <spna class="font-styling"
              >External stylesheet are stored in CSS files</spna
            >
          </p>

          <h1 class="titleh1">CSS Can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h1>
          <br />
          <ul class="css-ways">
            <li>Inline- by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>
            <li>Internal- by using a style elemnt in the head section</li>
            <li>
              External- by using a link element tyo link to an external CSS file
            </li>
            <li>
              The most common way to add CSS. is to keep the styles in external
              CSS files. however,
              <span
                >in this tutitorial we will use inline and internal
                styles,</span
              >
              because this is easier to demonstrate,and easier for you to try it
              yourself
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="p1">
            When comparing CSS class vs ID,the differnce is that CSS class applies a
            style to multiple elements.ID, on the other hand,applies a style to one
            unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL.to
            link directly to an element and it's used by JavaSript.
          </p>
          <p class="p2">
            In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of
            elements on a webpage. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set
            of styles can be applied to the elements.
          </p>
          <p class="p3">
            There is a wide range of selectors avialable.Two of the most commonly used
            are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should
            be applied
